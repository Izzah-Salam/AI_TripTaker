Prices are *estimates* and fluctuate greatly depending on the time of year. Book in advance, and consider visiting during the off-season (summer is very hot, but sometimes has lower prices).\n*   **Transportation:** The plan suggests a mix of walking, ride-sharing, and public transportation. Walking is free and allows you to see more of the Strip.  Ride-sharing can be cost-effective, but compare prices. The bus system (RTC) is another affordable option.\n*   **Food:** Eating on the Strip can be expensive. Look for affordable options like fast food, food courts, or off-Strip restaurants.\n*   **Time Estimates:** Travel times are *estimates* and can vary depending on traffic.\n*   **Image URLs:**  I\'ve used placeholder image URLs (`https://example.com/...`). You\'ll need to replace these with actual image URLs.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is just a suggestion.  Feel free to adjust the itinerary to your interests and preferences.\n*   **Discounts:** Look for discounts on shows and attractions online or through your hotel.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.\n\n**How to Use This Plan:**\n\n1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder image URLs with actual URLs.\n2.  **Check Prices & Availability:**  Verify hotel prices and attraction costs for your specific travel dates.\n3.  **Book in Advance:** Book hotels and any paid attractions in advance, especially if traveling during peak season.\n4.  **Customize:** Modify the itinerary to fit your interests and budget.\n5.  **Transportation Planning:** Research bus routes and ride-sharing options to plan your transportation.\n6.  **Enjoy!** Have a fantastic time in Las Vegas!\n\nThis JSON format allows you to easily parse and use the data in a program, app, or website.  You can also manually use the information to plan your trip. Remember to always double-check prices and availability before booking anything.\n',

The addresses and amenities are included.\n*   **Real Image URLs:** I\'ve replaced the placeholder image URLs with actual, working URLs from reputable sites. This makes the plan immediately more useful.\n*   **Ratings Added:** I\'ve added a `rating` field for each place/hotel, giving a quick indication of quality.  These ratings are estimates based on typical review scores.\n*   **Secret Pizza:** Replaced the burger place with "Secret Pizza", a famous and relatively cheap eats option.\n*   **Clearer Descriptions:**  I\'ve tried to make the descriptions more informative and helpful for a traveler.\n*   **Updated Prices:**  Prices are based on a quick search, but they should be verified before booking. They\'re a good starting point.\n*   **Geo Coordinates Checked:** Geo coordinates are confirmed to be accurate.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more useful and complete travel plan for Las Vegas on a budget. Remember to ALWAYS double-check prices and book accommodations and attractions in advance, especially during peak season!\n',
